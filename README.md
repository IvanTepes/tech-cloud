## Site Image

Welcome to Tech Cloud

Tech Cloud is a fully responsive, custom full stack-website, designed and built according to the wishes and needs of the users.

It allows all users to purchase products, subscribe to the newsletter and access the blog,
allows registered users to post and like the posts of other users, 
while giving the business owner complete control over the content of the site and advertising and promoting a particular product.

## Website Purpose:

Tech Cloud is an online web store intended for small and medium-sized businesses that sells a group of products related with their purpose.
With it's design, Tech Cloud tries to provide all its users with comfortable use with a set of features that will be explained in this document.

## Website Purpose (updated):

The creation and design of the Tech Cloud e-commerce website was part of the
 Education program for the Full Stack web developer at the Code Institute bootcamp.
 Since I was not happy with the first version of this site I decided to rebuild it and
 correct the mistakes I made during the first project when designing and organizing the
 whole project.

 First Project can be found HERE
 Live Site HERE

The main reason for rebuilding this site is to learn and better understand
 html, css, javascript, python and django.
